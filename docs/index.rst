Welcome to ProxyStore's documentation!
======================================

ProxyStore provides a streamlined interface for passing objects through remote object stores via proxies.
Proxies act as transparent wrappers to objects and provide just-in-time resolution of the wrapped objects.

ProxyStore can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/gpauloski/ProxyStore>`_.
